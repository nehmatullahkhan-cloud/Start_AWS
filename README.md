# 🌩️ AWS_Start – My AWS Learning Journey

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to my AWS learning journey!  
I’ve officially created my AWS account today (**📅 August 5, 2025**) and started exploring the AWS Management Console.

This repository will track all my progress, notes, and screenshots as I move forward toward becoming a **Certified AWS Cloud Engineer**.

## 🚀 Getting Started
